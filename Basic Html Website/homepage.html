                        <p>
                            Built a simple page to collect and authenticate user <br>
                            details for either signing up or loging in. This Flask application <br>
                            collects, validates/invalidates data and queries against a small SQLite database.

                            This project was to get acquainted with API requests and responses. <br>
                            What it does is to generate content with OpenAI on a certain topic and <br>
                            tweet it on specified times.

                        <p>
                            This is a private project for a domestic services renderer.<br>
                            The goal of the website is to connect independent domestic services enterprises<br>
                            with potential customers. As such the website collects user data, signs them up as either<br>
                            client or service renderer, and allows the user access to their appropriate tools.
                            With this project my knowledge on python was tested, as I had to not just build <br>
                            with the appropriate tools but also maintain and adhere to recommended professional <br>
                            practices and architecture in building webpages.
